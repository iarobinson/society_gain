The STD Campaign (Sterilize the Dogs)

It sucks to see puppies suffering. This one, Angel was on the doorway of death when we found her.

Luckily, in Salina Cruz, there is an organization called the Sociedad Protectora Animales (SPA). Joyce of SPA came and picked the poor soul up. Don't worry, Angel is recovering nicely, but we still have work to do. In order to stop future suffering, we must engage in an STD (Sterilize the Dogs) campaign!

Lets raise some funds for the STD campaign! With a fistful of pesos, Joyce, a vetrenarian and a handpicked volunteer crew can come to town and effect the STD campaign. They will work with local community to spay and neuter this horde of unloved street dogs.

To sterilize one dog, it costs $12.50 USD. Every dollar will go towards the sterilization of a dog or cat.

STD for the win!

This will go a long way in alleviating the suffering of cute puppies in a pretty place near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.

Adios muchachos!



<!-- Notes -->



This diseased puppy came to our door on the verge of death. We were able to get her to an organization to save her life.

That is great, but saving individual dogs doesn't address the root of the suffering.

In this small Mexican town, neglected dogs are a huge issue.

The organization made it clear the important issues is that we address the root of the suffering.

The root of the suffering is the procreation problem. These street dogs procreate at alarming rates and the puppies and dogs are abandoned at an alarming rate. One female dog can produce litters of 10 puppies destined for a hot, parched painful existeneces.

This problem can be solved! Best of yet, it's really not very difficult. the local organization already in place to solve the problem.


 problem can be solved by working with the community organization dedicated to doing this. They can work with the local people and we can pay for the supplies to sterilize the street dogs.

Once the street dogs are sterilized, they will enjoy lives with far less suffering.

If you're into helping


 and develop skin diseases like mange and scabies, and many are left to the streets or beaches to fend for themselves.


There is a small surf town in Oaxaca, Mexico in which there is severe suffering which can be solved.


. it can be addressed inexpensively and with just a drop of help sent to the right people. The goal of this is to raise that small amount of money to get . It is extremely hot and dry, with harsh conditions.

If you didn’t already know,

Last month we saved this poor little 4 month old puppy (who we named Angel) she was in immense pain, and suffering badly from scabies. She was malnourished and neglected, and left to die. We fed her but her condition worsened.

Thankfully we connected with an amazing rescue organization in Salina Cruz, and because of the unbelievable love, care and dedication by Joyce and The Society Protecting Animals we were able to get this little puppy the care she needed, before it was too late for her.  Unfortunately all puppies aren’t as lucky as our little Angel.

The Solution:

But, there is an answer. This problem can be stopped through sterilisation.

And the great news is Joyce is on a mission in Salina Cruz, to stop the cruelty and abuse of dogs and cats. She wants to protect and help as many animals as possible.  Everyday she rescues dogs and cats, rehabilitates them, gives them the medical treatment and care they need to become healthy and strong, and then finds loving homes for them. But the most important thing is she is on a mission to sterilise all dogs and cats to stop this problem, one litter at a time. If the animals aren't sterilised then the problem will continue to happen, and many more Angel's will live terrible existences. This is not humane. This is not OK.

In rural areas such as Playa Brazil, Mexicans are on minimum wage which means a person could be making a measly $7 USD a day. That means even if they did want too, it is very hard for someone here to afford to take care of an animal. They need to first support themselves, and their families with the essential needs of shelter, food and water.

In foreign countries, relationships to our pets, especially dogs, is something so unique and a huge part of our culture. It is distinctly different in Mexico, and it is evident that people do not have a close connection to their dogs, and unfortunately probably never will. It is just not a part of the culture here.

It is unfortunate, but that’s why it’s important for us to do what we can to help these furry friends, and the small community of Mexican's who do advocate for animals, and all other foreigners doing great work to rescue and save the animals.

The Costs:

We are hopeful, because to sterilize an animal here it costs just $12.50 USD per animal.

Our goal is to raise enough money so we can sterilize 100 dogs in the next 10 days. Total = $1,250 USD.

$12.50 USD isn’t alot to many foreigners, but unfortunately it is to Mexicans.

How You Can Help:

This is why we want to make this our mission, to not only help the people in the community with this issue, but specially the dogs so puppies aren’t birthed into a society where they are unwanted, and the dogs here are not continuously procreating. Steralisation is the only solution that will put an end to this problem.

We are asking for every animal lover to donate what they can to support us in our mission.

Once we meet our goal we will have the vet from Salina Cruz come with Joyce and volunteers from Society Protecting Animals and they will sterilize as many animals as they can with the money that we have raised.

Seeing the pain and suffering this poor little puppy had to endure was absolutely devastating, and to know hundreds more are going through this each day is absolutely heartbreaking.

But if they are sterilized then we can prevent the abuse and devastation happening to these dogs, and these poor puppies from being neglected and living a terrible existence and dying a painful death.

Every dollar counts! If you can donate $5, great! If you can donate $10, awesome! If you can donate $12.50, amazing!! This is one dog or cat sterilised! 100% of all funds raised will be given to the vet to sterilize dogs in Playa Brazil. Every dollar will help a dog and cat in need.

PLEASE DONATE NOW so we can get as many dogs sterilized by May 10th!

We’d be forever grateful if you could help us help the animals of Playa Brazil. Thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts.

These photos are of what happens to neglected puppies and dogs here. It is awful. Every dog steralised will help the root cause of this problem, and prevent this from happening to more dogs in the future.
